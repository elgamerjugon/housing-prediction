# housing-prediction
This project is part of my portfolio for learning AI

🏗️ Project Plan: Housing Price Prediction
✅ 1. Define the Objective
Predict the price of a house based on features like number of rooms, location, size, etc.

📦 2. Get the Dataset
Here are some solid datasets you can use:

🏠 Kaggle – House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
📎 https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

🧱 Ames Housing Dataset (via Scikit-learn or public repo)
📎 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset

🧪 3. Project Steps
📌 Week Plan (1 hour/day for 1 week)
Day	Task
1	Load the data, understand the features, and clean nulls
2	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): distributions, correlations
3	Feature engineering: handle categoricals, scale numerical
4	Train baseline model (LinearRegression, DecisionTree)
5	Try advanced models (RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost)
6	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
7	Evaluate (R², RMSE), save model, and prepare deployment

🛠️ Recommended Tools & Tech
Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn/Matplotlib (EDA)

Scikit-learn (models, pipelines, preprocessing)

XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost (boosted trees)

MLflow or Joblib (optional for experiment tracking/model saving)

Streamlit or Flask (for deployment/UI)

📈 Model Suggestions
Start simple and move up:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
✅ Metrics to Evaluate
RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error

MAE – Mean Absolute Error

R² Score – Coefficient of determination

💡 Bonus Ideas
Add a map-based visualization (using Folium or GeoPandas)

Add interactive filtering with Streamlit

Try using K-Fold Cross-validation

🔄 After It’s Done
🎥 Make a short TikTok/Instagram video showing the predictions

📄 Share the notebook and repo on GitHub

🚀 Deploy a mini web app using Streamlit

If you want, I can generate:

A full folder structure for the project

A ready-to-use Streamlit dashboard
